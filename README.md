# Kinetic Heaps

Welcome to the Kinetic Heaps project repository! This project aims to implement the Kinetic Heaps data structure as part of our team course project. Kinetic Heaps combine the concepts of heap data structures with kinetics, making them suitable for scenarios where elements' priorities change over time.

## Introduction

Kinetic Heaps are dynamic data structures that support operations such as insertion, deletion, and querying of elements with changing priorities. They are particularly useful in applications where the priorities of elements are not static but evolve over time.

## Features

- Efficient support for priority updates.
- Operations such as insert, delete, and query optimized for dynamic environments.
- Suitable for real-time systems and applications with changing priorities.

## Usage

To use Kinetic Heaps in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FrenzyVJN/DSA-Project.git
    ```

2. Include the necessary files in your project.
with Kinetic Heaps.
